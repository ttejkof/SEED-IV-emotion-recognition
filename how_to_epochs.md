**Here's how you can accomplish this using the MNE library in Python,** along with explanations:

**1. Install Necessary Libraries**

Make sure you have MNE and NumPy installed. If not, use pip:

Bash

```
pip install mne numpy
```

**2. Import the Libraries**

Python

```
import mne
import numpy as np
```

**3. Load Your Recording Data**

Let's assume you already have your recording loaded into an MNE Raw object named `raw`. If not, you'll need to load it from your file format.

**4. Define Epoch Parameters**

Python

```
epoch_duration = 5  # Duration of each epoch in seconds
overlap_percentage = 0.5  # Overlap as a percentage of epoch duration
overlap_duration = epoch_duration * overlap_percentage  # Overlap in seconds
```

**5. Calculate Epoching Parameters**

Python

```
n_epochs = int(np.ceil((raw.times[-1] - epoch_duration) / (epoch_duration - overlap_duration))) + 1
tmin = 0  # Starting time of the first epoch
tmax = epoch_duration  # Ending time of the first epoch
event_times = np.arange(n_epochs) * (epoch_duration - overlap_duration) + tmin 
```

**6. Create Epochs**

Python

```
events = np.c_[event_times, np.zeros(n_epochs), np.ones(n_epochs)]  # Simple event markers
epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id={'Epoch': 1}, tmin=tmin, tmax=tmax, baseline=None, preload=True)
```

**Explanation**

* **Epoch Duration and Overlap:** You define the desired duration of each epoch and the percentage of overlap.
* **Calculating Epochs:**`n_epochs` determines the total number of epochs needed to cover your recording, taking into account the overlap.`event_times` creates an array to mark the start time of each epoch.
* **Creating Events:**  An array of events is created, where each event signifies the start of an epoch.
* **mne.Epochs:**  The  `mne.Epochs` object is the central way to represent epoched data in MNE.  You supply your raw data,  the events array, parameters for the start and end of each epoch (`tmin`,`tmax`), and an indication that you want the data to be loaded immediately (`preload=True`).

**Key Points**

* Make sure your recording data's sampling rate is compatible with the defined epoch and overlap durations.
* The created `epochs` object is an MNE Epochs object that allows you to slice, manipulate, and analyze your data in 5-second epochs with the specified overlap.

Let me know if you want to further process these epochs or have a specific use case in mind!
